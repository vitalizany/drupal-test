Another way to update htaccess

"file-mapping": {
    "[web-root]/.htaccess": {
        "append": "patches/htaccess-ssl-redirect.txt"
    }
}


<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>

  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
  # This checks to make sure the connection is not already HTTPS

  RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]
  # This rule will redirect users from their original location, to the same location but using HTTPS.

</IfModule>
